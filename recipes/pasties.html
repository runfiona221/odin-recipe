  <h2>Golden crumbly pastry with a Tasty meal inside.</h2>
  <p>Cornish Pasties are hot, flakey, and filled with beef, potatoes, onion, and parsnips or carrots. Pasties are great
    for people on the go; minors used to carry pasties to work as it was a hot, tasty, and an inexpensive meal. At one
    time, the pasty was a whole meal with meat and potatoes on one side and a dessert of jam or apple on the other end,
    although you will only find meat and potatoes or vegetarian pasties filled with cheese and potatoes today. </p>

    <li>2 cups white flour (pinch of salt if desired)</li>

  <h2>How to make the Pastry Crust</h2>
  <p>Place the flour, salt, and fat in a food processor, mixer, or hand and pulse a few times until combined. It will be
    crumbly. Add the water a little at a time until the pastry comes together. DO NOT over-mix the dough, or it will be
    tough. Roll up dough and refrigerate for 20 minutes or longer when done, cut into four equal parts and roll out into
    a circle to place Ingredients inside.</p>

  <p>Layer the filling: Begin with turnip or carrot and onion, shallot, or leek down the center, then add a layer of
    potatoes and steak. Leave about 3/4 inch space on the top and bottom edges of the pastry dough. Lightly sprinkle
    with salt and pepper. Bring up pastry edges and squeeze shut. Next, add egg wash to the pasties for a beautiful
    brown color.</p>
